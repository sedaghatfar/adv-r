# Base types {#base-types}

To talk about objects and OOP in R we need to first deal with a fundamental confusion: we use the word object to mean two different things. So far in this book, we've used object in a general sense, as captured by John Chambers' summary: "Everything that exists in R is an object". However, while everything _is_ an object, not everything is "object-oriented". Most of the time, this distinction is not important. But here we need to get into the nitty gritty details so we'll use the terms __base objects__ and __OO objects__ to distinguish the categories.

```{r, out.width = NULL, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/oo-venn.png", dpi = 300)
```

This is one of the more confusing parts of the book because this system was not designed, but evolved over the course of many years, and many iterations of S.

```{r setup}
library(sloop)
```

## Base objects vs OO objects

To tell the difference between a base and OO object, use `is.object()`:

```{r}
is.object(1:10)
is.object(mtcars)
```

(This function would be better called `is.oo()` because it tells you if an object is a base object or a OO object.)

The primary attribute that distinguishes between base and OO object is the "class". Base objects do not have a class attribute:

```{r}
attr(1:10, "class")
attr(mtcars, "class")
```

Note, however, that `class()` never returns `NULL`: it's the class attribute that determines whether an object is OO or not, not the value of the `class()` _function_.  Later, we'll come back to what `class()` does return for base objects.

```{r}
class(1:10)
```

While only OO objects have a class attribute, every object has a __base type__:

```{r}
typeof(1:10)
typeof(mtcars)
```

This is because every OO object is built on top of a base object.

Base objects do not form an OOP system because functions that behave differently for different base types are almost always written in C, where dispatch occurs using switch statements (e.g., `switch(TYPEOF(x))`). This means only R-core can create new types. As a consequence, new base types are added very rarely. The most recent change, in 2011, added two exotic types that you never see in R, but are needed for diagnosing memory problems (`NEWSXP` and `FREESXP`). Prior to that, the last type added was a special base type for S4 objects (`S4SXP`) in 2005. \indexc{SEXP} \index{base types} \index{objects!base types}

## Type, class, mode, storage mode

Above you saw 

*   The vectors and NULL: NULL, logical, integer, double, complex, character,
    list, raw.
    
    ```{r}
    typeof(1:10)
    typeof(NULL)
    typeof(1i)
    ```
    
*   Language components: symbol (aka names), language (usually called calls),
    pairlist (used for function arguments).

    ```{r}
    typeof(quote(a))
    typeof(quote(a + 1))
    typeof(formals(mean))
    ```
    
*   Environments

    ```{r}
    typeof(globalenv())
    ```
    
*   Functions: closure (regular R functions), special (internal functions), 
    builtin (primitive functions).
    
    ```{r}
    typeof(mean)
    typeof(sum)
    typeof(`[`)
    ```
   
*  Expressions are a special purpose data type that's only returned by 
   `parse()` and `expression()`. They are not needed in user code.
        
*  There are a few esoteric types that are important for C code but not 
   generally available at the R level: externalptr, weakref, bytecode, S4,
   promise, "...", and any.

You may have heard of `mode()` and `storage.mode()`. I recommend ignoring these functions because they just provide S compatible aliases of `typeof()`. Read the source code if you want to understand exactly what they do. \indexc{mode()}

The `class()` of a base type is confusing set of rules that evolved over multiple years. Generally, it is not important except when it comes to S3 dispatch, which we'll discuss in the next section.

## The is functions

<!-- https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/880337b753960bf77c6ccd8badca634e0f2a4914/src/main/coerce.c#L1764 -->

This is also a good place to discuss the `is` functions because they're often used to check if an object has a specific type:

```{r}
is.function(mean)
is.primitive(sum)
```

Generally, "is" functions that check if an object is a specific type are ok. "is" functions that check for a family of types are often surprising. For example, `is.atomic(NULL)` is true, and as well as checking that an object is a vector, `is.vector()` also checks that it has no attributes apart from names.

Can be surprising if you don't understand which category a function belongs to.

*   Specific base types check for a single specific value of `typeof()`:
    `is.call()`, `is.character()`, `is.complex()`, 
    `is.double()`, `is.environment()`, `is.expression()`,
    `is.list()`, `is.logical()`, `is.name()`, `is.null()`, `is.pairlist()`,
    `is.raw()`, `is.symbol()`.
    
    `is.integer()` is almost in this class, but it specifically checks for the
    absense of a class attribute containing "factor".
  
*   Combination of base types: 

    * `is.atomic()` = logical, integer, double, character, raw, and 
      (surprisingly) NULL.
      
    * `is.function()` = special, builtin, closure.
    * `is.primitive()` = special, built-in
    
    * `is.language()` = symbol, language, expression.
    
    * `is.recursive()` = list, language, expression

*   Some functions the check attributes: `is.array()` (looks at dim), 
    `is.leaf()`, `is.matrix()` (dim), `is.vector()` (anything except names).
  
    `is.vector()` is particularly confusing because you might expect it 
    to check for 

* Has an S3 class: `is.data.frame()`, `is.factor()`, `is.mts()`, 
  `is.numeric_version()`, `is.ordered()`, `is.package_version()`, `is.qr()`, 
  `is.raster()`, `is.relistable()`, `is.stepfun()`, `is.table()`, `is.ts()`,
  `is.tskernel()`, 

* Vectorised math ops: `is.finite()`, `is.infinite()`, `is.na()`, `is.nan()`

* Finally there are a bunch of special purpose functions that don't 
  fall into any other category: `is.empty.model()` `is.loaded()`, 
  `is.object()`, `is.R()`, `is.single()`, `is.unsorted()`. 
  
      `is.element()` is even more different as it takes two arguments,
      unlike every other `is`. function.

One, `is.numeric()`, is sufficiently special that it gets its own section.



### The numeric "type"

We need a little extra discussion of the numeric "type" because it's used in three different ways in different places in R.

1.  In some places it's used as an alias for "double".  For example
    `as.numeric()` is identical to `as.double()`, and `numeric()` is
    identical to `double()`.
    
1.  In S3 and S4 it is used to mean either integer or double. We'll
    talk about `s3_class()` in the next chapter:

    ```{r}
    s3_class(1)
    s3_class(1L)
    ```

1.  In some places it means an object built on a base type of integer or 
    double that also has numeric behaviour (i.e. arithmetic makes sense and 
    you can order by numeric values)
    
    ```{r}
    is.numeric(1)
    is.numeric(1L)
    
    is.numeric(factor("x"))
    is.integer(factor("x"))
    ```

Finally, there are few places in which R uses "real" instead of double; `NA_real_` is the one place that you're likely to encounter this in practice.
